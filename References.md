## Citation Examples for Assignment

### In-text citation examples:

**Single author:**
- Leveson (2011) argues that accidents are caused by inadequate control rather than component failures.
- Traditional hazard analysis methods struggle with software-intensive systems (Leveson, 2011).

**Two authors:**
- Parasuraman and Riley (1997) identified four patterns of automation interaction: use, misuse, disuse, and abuse.
- Automation bias can lead operators to over-rely on automated systems (Parasuraman & Riley, 1997).

**Three or more authors:**
- Wickens et al. (2013) describe information processing as a series of stages from perception to response.

**Direct quote:**
- "Situation awareness is the perception of elements in the environment within a volume of time and space, the comprehension of their meaning, and the projection of their status in the near future" (Endsley, 1995, p. 36).
